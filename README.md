# Rock-paper-Scissors-Game
This is a basic Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows the user to play against the computer, handles game logic dynamically, and displays results instantly. The project helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.
